# RL4 Strategic Plan — BASELINE v1.0 (ARCHIVED)

**Note:** This is the original baseline saved before accepting E4 drift.
Phase E4 was accepted as the natural fulfillment of E3.3's vision: "production-ready Dev Continuity System."

## Original Phase (E3.3)
Single Context Snapshot System

## Original Goal
Transform RL4 from cognitive experiment into production-ready Dev Continuity System.

## Original Timeline
- Phase E3.3 Start: 2025-11-10
- Target: 2025-11-13 (3 days)
- Status: Completed successfully

## Original Objectives
1. ✅ Simplify UI to 1 button ("Generate Context Snapshot")
2. ✅ Eliminate fake/static data (patterns, forecasts, goals)
3. ✅ Establish agent feedback loop (prompt → agent → .RL4 files → RL4 parses)
4. ✅ Create persistent state files (Plan/Tasks/Context/ADRs.RL4)
5. ✅ Historical compression (30 days → 2KB JSON)
6. ✅ ADR auto-detection (commit scoring)
7. ✅ Deviation Guard (baseline tracking)

## What Changed (E3.3 → E4)
- **Phase:** E3.3 "Single Context Snapshot" → E4 "Smart UI with Workspace Insights"
- **Goal:** Production-ready system → Production-ready + Marketplace-ready UI
- **Timeline:** 3 days → 4 days (+1 day for UI polish)
- **Features Added:**
  1. UI-Driven Deviation Mode (ADR-009)
  2. Smart UI Components (4 KPI cards: Cognitive Load, Next Tasks, Plan Drift, Risks)
  3. Enhanced tooltips (❓ icon, better content, animations)
  4. Production-ready wordings (removed all internal references)
  5. Mermaid diagrams in ADRs (006-011)
  6. ADR-011 (Bias Recalibration Framework)

## Why E4 Was Accepted
1. **Value Created:** E4 features solve real UX problems ("Et alors ? C'est grave ?")
2. **Quality:** All work tested, no regressions, marketplace-ready
3. **Intentional:** Each feature deliberately added (not accidental scope creep)
4. **ROI:** 10 hours invested in high-value features
5. **Market Fit:** Production-ready extension > internal experiment
6. **Vision Alignment:** E4 = fulfillment of E3.3's "production-ready" goal

## Final Metrics at Archive
- **Confidence:** 88%
- **Bias:** 63%
- **Commits:** 9 (all feature/fix, 100% ADR-worthy)
- **System Health:** Excellent (284MB memory, 0.06ms event loop)
- **Uncommitted:** 19 files

## Decision
Option A: Accept Drift — E4 becomes new baseline v2.0 (bias reset to 0%)
