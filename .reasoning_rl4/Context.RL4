# RL4 Operational Context

## KPIs (LLM-Calculated)

### Cognitive Load: 34% (Normal)
- Bursts: 1 (UnifiedPromptBuilder.ts: 24 edits in <1min)
- Switches: 25 (estimated from timeline activity)
- Parallel Tasks: 0 (no active "in_progress" tasks)
- Uncommitted Files: 21 ⚠️ HIGH (>15 threshold)

**Calculation:** `(1/10 * 0.3) + (25/50 * 0.2) + (0/3 * 0.3) + (21/20 * 0.2) = 0.34`

### Next Steps (Flexible Mode — ⚠️ BIAS ALERT: 58% > 25%)
1. **[P0] URGENT:** Commit 21 uncommitted files (data loss risk)
2. **[P1] PRIORITY:** Document 6 potential ADRs (commits b21ac31, e41ff8c, 97e4843, f9d61c4, 7e358cb, 140406e)
3. **[P1] CONTINUE:** Complete Smart UI Components (CognitiveLoadCard, NextStepsCard, PlanDriftCard, RisksCard)
4. **[P1] RECALIBRATE:** Decide on 58% bias (accept deviation or revert to baseline)

### Plan Drift: 58% ⚠️ EXCEEDS FLEXIBLE THRESHOLD (25%)
- Phase: E3.3 → E4 (changed)
- Goal: 70% different from baseline
- Timeline: +1 day (3→4 days, 33% drift)
- Tasks: +3 added (not in original plan)
- **Impact:** Strategic direction drifted significantly

### Risks
- 🔴 **21 uncommitted files** (>15 threshold, high data loss risk)
- 🟡 **Burst activity** (UnifiedPromptBuilder.ts: 24 edits in <1min, possible debugging session)
- 🟡 **Long gap** (34min break: 16:04→16:38, potential blocker?)
- 🟢 **System health:** Excellent (284MB memory stable, 0.09ms event loop p50)

## Recent Activity
- Cycles: 710
- Commits: 0
- Duration: 2h
- File bursts: 3 rapid iterations detected
  - TASKS_RL4.md (20 edits/min)
  - RL4Messages.ts (6 edits/min)
  - App.tsx (16 edits/min)

## Health
- Memory: 279 MB (-42 MB vs 2h ago) ✅ Stable, no leaks
- Event Loop: 0.08ms p50 (excellent responsiveness)
- Uptime: 47 hours (recent restart detected)

### Recent Commits (Git)
1. `cd12100` - chore: stable state before Vite migration
2. `14b103b` - feat(mcp): Add manifest endpoint + Cursor integration
3. `03a4e81` - feat(mcp): Add read-only MCP server
4. `4da506b` - feat(kernel): Pipeline cognitif 100% + α dynamique

### ADRs in Effect
- ADR-004: JSONL ledgers for persistence
- ADR-003: CognitiveSnapshot as source of truth
- ADR-002: WebView for visualization
- ADR-001: Modular kernel architecture

## Key Patterns
- **✅ Debugging Phase Complete**: 
  - WebView API acquisition fixed (App.tsx: 16 edits in 30s)
  - FileWatcher integration validated (extension.ts: 12 edits)
  - ADR parser regex adjusted (ADRParser.ts)
- **✅ System Stability**: 
  - Memory decreasing trend (healthy)
  - Event loop <0.1ms (no blocking)
  - No crashes in last 47h
- **🔄 Development Stage**:
  - Phase E3.3 core implementation: DONE
  - Next milestone: E2E feedback loop validation
  - Ready for first real agent test

## Blind Spots Addressed
- Timeline analysis (710 cycles parsed)
- File change patterns (burst detection)
- Git history context (10 commits analyzed)
- System health trends (memory/event loop/uptime)

## Agent Observations

**🚨 DEVIATION ALERT (58% > 25% threshold):**
The system has significantly drifted from original plan baseline. Phase changed (E3.3→E4), goal 70% different, timeline extended. This drift was accepted incrementally (+10% for documentation, +28% for additional features), but now exceeds flexible threshold.

**Options:**
1. **Accept drift:** Update baseline to E4 as new reference (reset bias to 0%)
2. **Recalibrate:** Review E4 objectives, remove non-essential features
3. **Continue:** Acknowledge 58% bias, proceed with P1 tasks

**Positive Developments:**
- ✅ Phase E3.3 objectives 100% complete
- ✅ ADR-008, ADR-009, ADR-010 documented with full traceability
- ✅ UI-Driven Deviation Mode implemented (15:45)
- ✅ Mermaid diagrams added to all ADRs (16:05)
- ✅ System health excellent (no memory leaks, event loop responsive)

**Concerns:**
- ⚠️ 21 uncommitted files (risk of losing work)
- ⚠️ 6 commits (100% ADR score) not yet documented
- ⚠️ Bias continues to grow without explicit user decision

**Timeline Patterns (Last 2h):**
- 537 cycles (4.5/min sustained rate)
- 1 burst session (UnifiedPromptBuilder.ts debugging)
- 1 long gap (34min) suggests possible blocker or meeting
- Activity distribution: steady afternoon work session

**Git Activity:**
- Last 10 commits: 7 features, 3 fixes (healthy mix)
- Recent: b21ac31 (Smart UI Phase 1), e41ff8c (i18n fix)
- All commits scored 100% for ADR detection (high architectural impact)

## Recommendations — MODE FLEXIBLE (⚠️ 58% > 25%)

**IMMEDIATE (P0):**
1. **Commit 21 files** — Data loss risk mitigation
2. **User decision on 58% bias** — Accept/Recalibrate/Continue?

**PRIORITY (P1):**
1. **Document 6 ADRs** — Commits b21ac31, e41ff8c, 97e4843, f9d61c4, 7e358cb, 140406e all scored 100%
2. **Complete Smart UI Components** — CognitiveLoadCard, NextStepsCard, PlanDriftCard, RisksCard (3/7 remaining)
3. **Test Context.RL4 parser** — Validate KPI section reading

**SECONDARY (P2):**
1. **Real-time .RL4 file refresh** — FileWatchers → UI update
2. **Interactive ADR timeline** — Visualize decision history

**GUARD RAILS (Flexible Mode):**
- New ideas → Calculate bias impact first
- If new_bias + 58% > 80% → STOP, ask user
- P0+P1 tasks → Proceed immediately
- P2+ tasks → Add to backlog unless user approves
