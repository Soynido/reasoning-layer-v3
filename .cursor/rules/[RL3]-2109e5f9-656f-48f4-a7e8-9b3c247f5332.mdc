# Adoption of a modular architecture through specialized capture engines

**Identifiant**: 2109e5f9-656f-48f4-a7e8-9b3c247f5332

## Contexte
- Development shows the creation of 4 separate engines (SBOMCaptureEngine, ConfigCaptureEngine, TestCaptureEngine, GitMetadataEngine). The intention was to decouple capture responsibilities by technical domain.

## Décision
- The choice made: one engine per metadata type rather than a monolithic capture system. This decision aimed to improve maintainability and test each capture engine independently.

## Conséquences
- Observable impact: code is more modular, each engine can evolve without affecting others. This facilitates the addition of new capture engines.
