# Stabilizing the persistence contract via versioned manifest

**Identifiant**: f82a9f56-b33d-41c4-b485-7174ac33aee1

## Contexte
- The developer iterated 25 times on PersistenceManager and 11 times on ManifestGenerator. The implicit intention was to guarantee the consistency of captured data.

## Décision
- The choice made: implement a local-first persistence engine with versioned manifest and Zod schema for validation. This decision aimed to avoid data corruption and facilitate debugging.

## Conséquences
- Observable impact: local architecture without server dependency === systematic event validation, manifest always consistent with traces.
