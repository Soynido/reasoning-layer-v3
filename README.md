# Reasoning Layer V3

> *An intelligent reasoning engine that transforms raw development traces into structured architectural knowledge, enabling teams to understand why decisions were made, when they happened, and what will come next.*

---

## üéØ What Is This?

**Reasoning Layer V3** is a VS Code extension that captures, analyzes, and reasons about your codebase's evolution. Unlike traditional documentation tools, it autonomously:

- üì∏ **Captures** development traces (commits, files, dependencies, tests)
- üß† **Synthesizes** architectural decisions (ADRs) from evidence
- üîó **Correlates** internal decisions with external signals (metrics, feedback, incidents)
- üîÆ **Forecasts** future decisions based on historical patterns
- üîê **Maintains** integrity through cryptographic signatures and audit trails

**Think of it as a time-traveling code archaeologist and fortune teller combined into one.**

---

## üß† Core Concept: RBOM (Reasoning Bill of Materials)

Traditional SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials) list *what* software contains. **RBOM** (Reasoning Bill of Materials) explains *why* it was built that way.

An RBOM captures:
- **Architectural Decisions (ADRs)**: "We chose Redis for caching because..."
- **Evidence**: Links to PRs, issues, discussions, benchmarks
- **Context**: Who made the decision, when, and what triggered it
- **Impact**: How the decision affected the system
- **Evolution**: How decisions were superseded or refined

This transforms hidden tribal knowledge into explicit, searchable, learnable knowledge.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture: 7 Layers of Intelligence

The system is organized into 7 progressively sophisticated layers:

### **Layer 1: Code & Structure Capture** ‚úÖ
The foundation. Automatically captures:
- Git commits (hash, author, message, diff summary)
- Dependencies (name, version, license via SBOM)
- Configuration files (YAML, TOML, ENV)
- Test reports and coverage
- Build metadata

**Status**: Production-ready | 594 events captured | 0 errors

---

### **Layer 2: Cognitive Layer (RBOM)** ‚úÖ
The reasoning core. Generates and manages:
- **RBOM Engine**: ADR CRUD operations with Zod validation
- **Decision Synthesizer**: Auto-detect patterns and generate ADR proposals
- **Evidence Mapper**: Link capture events to ADRs
- **Quality Scorer**: Evaluate evidence strength and completeness

**Metrics**: 8 ADRs generated | 73 high-quality evidence items | Evidence quality distribution tracked

**Example Output**:
```json
{
  "id": "adr-001",
  "title": "Implement Redis caching layer",
  "context": "Performance feedback indicates latency issues",
  "decision": "Add Redis cache for session storage",
  "consequences": "Reduced p99 latency by 60%, increased infra cost by 15%",
  "evidence": [
    { "type": "commit", "quality": 0.85, "ref": "abc123" },
    { "type": "issue", "quality": 0.92, "ref": "#42" }
  ],
  "confidence": 0.87
}
```

---

### **Layer 3: Human & Organizational Context** ‚úÖ
Captures the *who* behind the decisions:
- Contributor detection from Git history
- Expertise inference (Testing, Frontend, Backend, Database, DevOps)
- Activity tracking (commit counts, first/last seen, files owned)
- Export to `human-context.json`

**Example**: Detected "Soynido" with 77 commits across 4 domains (Testing, Frontend, Backend, Database)

---

### **Layer 4: Evidence & Trace** ‚úÖ
Deep evidence analysis:
- Evidence quality scoring (Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor)
- Evidence grouping by type (PR, Issue, Commit, Benchmark)
- Top evidence display (highest quality first)
- Quality distribution tracking

**Metrics**: 10 evidence items analyzed | 60% average quality | Quality labels assigned

---

### **Layer 5: Integrity & Persistence** ‚úÖ
Ensures trustworthiness:
- **Hash & Signature Engine**: SHA256 hashing + RSA signing
- **Integrity Chain**: Append-only JSONL ledger
- **Snapshot Manager**: Signed manifests with hash chains
- **Lifecycle Manager**: Retention policies & status tracking

**Features**: Auto-sign ADRs | Ledger verification | Snapshot generation

---

### **Layer 6: External Context** ‚úÖ
Bridges internal decisions with real-world signals:
- **Product Metrics**: DAU (15k), Conversions (1.2k), Uptime (99.9%)
- **User Feedback**: Feature requests, bug reports, satisfaction scores
- **Compliance**: Regulatory requirements (GDPR, SOC2)
- **Market Signals**: Competitor benchmarks, technology trends
- **Incidents**: Postmortems, root cause analysis

**Integration**: 5 external sources synced | 10 evidence items imported | 80% average confidence

**Example Insight**:
> "Performance feedback on caching correlates with an incident postmortem, predicting a cache refactor ADR in Q2 2026."

---

### **Layer 7: Reasoning & Forecast** ‚è≥ In Progress
The intelligence layer‚Äîpredicts what comes next:

#### **Pattern Learning Engine (PLE)** ‚úÖ
Analyzes historical data to extract patterns:
- **Structural**: "Incident + Feedback ‚Üí Config Update ADR" (confidence: 87%)
- **Cognitive**: "Refactor decisions ‚Üí Reduced incidents"
- **Contextual**: "Market trends ‚Üí Tech migration"

**Metrics**: 4 patterns detected | 80-87% confidence scores | Recommendation generation

#### **Correlation Engine** ‚úÖ
Detects unexpected relationships:
- Pattern matches and divergences
- Semantic + temporal + impact scoring
- Types: confirming, diverging, emerging

**Metrics**: 2 correlations detected | Scores: 0.64-0.75 | Emerging correlations identified

#### **Forecast Engine** ‚úÖ
Predicts future decisions:
- Probability of new ADRs
- Emerging risks (tech debt, performance)
- Strategic opportunities (migration, features)
- Confidence scores and timeframes

**Example Forecast**:
```json
{
  "predicted_decision": "Refactor caching strategy",
  "decision_type": "ADR_Proposal",
  "confidence": 0.72,
  "suggested_timeframe": "H2 2026",
  "rationale": [
    "Pattern: Performance Issues ‚Üí Cache Decisions",
    "Correlation: emerging (score: 0.75)"
  ]
}
```

#### **ADR Synthesizer 2.0** (Planned)
- Auto-generate ADR drafts from forecasts
- Create proposal ADRs with context
- Require human validation

#### **Bias Monitor** (Planned)
- Detect reasoning biases
- Generate alerts for potential errors

- **Document as you code**: ADRs auto-generate from evidence

### For Researchers
- **Study decision patterns**: Analyze how architectures evolve
- **Predict refactors**: Forecast technical debt accumulation
- **Correlate signals**: Link user feedback to architectural changes
