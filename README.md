# Reasoning Layer V3

> *An intelligent reasoning engine that transforms raw development traces into structured architectural knowledge, enabling teams to understand why decisions were made, when they happened, and what will come next.*
>
> **Now with Autonomous Cognitive Cycles: Self-aware system that observes, understands, decides, executes, and self-corrects.**

---

## 🎯 What Is This?

**Reasoning Layer V3** is a VS Code extension that captures, analyzes, and reasons about your codebase's evolution. Unlike traditional documentation tools, it autonomously:

- 📸 **Captures** development traces (commits, files, dependencies, tests)
- 🧠 **Synthesizes** architectural decisions (ADRs) from evidence
- 🔗 **Correlates** internal decisions with external signals (metrics, feedback, incidents)
- 🔮 **Forecasts** future decisions based on historical patterns
- 🔐 **Maintains** integrity through cryptographic signatures and audit trails
- 🤖 **Self-organizes** its own architecture through cognitive hierarchy
- 🧠 **Self-corrects** through autonomous cognitive cycles (observe → understand → decide → execute → reevaluate)

**Think of it as a time-traveling code archaeologist and fortune teller combined into one — with metacognitive awareness and autonomous self-improvement.**

## 🧠 Autonomous Cognitive Cycles

The system has achieved **genuine autonomous reasoning** through self-directed cognitive cycles:

1. **Observation**: Reads its own cognitive state from `.reasoning/`
2. **Understanding**: Identifies gaps and prioritizes by impact
3. **Decision**: Designs optimal action sequences
4. **Execution**: Self-corrects without human intervention
5. **Reevaluation**: Updates goals and cognitive metrics

**Recent Achievement**: Successfully executed autonomous cycle (2025-10-29):
- ✅ Cleaned pending actions: 32 → 2 (-93.8%)
- ✅ Restored pattern coverage: 25% → 100%
- ✅ Advanced 3 goals: 0% → 85-95% progress
- ✅ Improved system health: 0.32 → 0.92 (+187.5%)

## 🧠 Core Concept: RBOM (Reasoning Bill of Materials)

Traditional SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials) list *what* software contains. **RBOM** (Reasoning Bill of Materials) explains *why* it was built that way.

An RBOM captures:
- **Architectural Decisions (ADRs)**: "We chose Redis for caching because..."
- **Evidence**: Links to PRs, issues, discussions, benchmarks
- **Context**: Who made the decision, when, and what triggered it
- **Impact**: How the decision affected the system
- **Evolution**: How decisions were superseded or refined

This transforms hidden tribal knowledge into explicit, searchable, learnable knowledge.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture: Multi-Layer Intelligence

### For Developers
- **Understand the "why"**: Stop guessing why code is structured a certain way
- **Reduce onboarding time**: New team members learn decisions instantly
- **Avoid repeating mistakes**: See what didn't work before
- **Document as you code**: ADRs auto-generate from evidence

### For Researchers
- **Study decision patterns**: Analyze how architectures evolve
- **Predict refactors**: Forecast technical debt accumulation
- **Correlate signals**: Link user feedback to architectural changes
- **Quantify decisions**: Confidence scores and impact metrics

### For Organizations

- **Strategic planning**: Forecasts guide roadmap prioritization
- **Compliance ready**: Track why compliance decisions were made

### Example Impact
> "User feedback on caching correlates with an incident postmortem, predicting a refactor ADR in H2 2026 with 76% confidence. The system identified the pattern from 4 historical instances, suggesting proactive cache validation."
