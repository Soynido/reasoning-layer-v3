# Reasoning Layer V3

> *An intelligent reasoning engine that transforms raw development traces into structured architectural knowledge, enabling teams to understand why decisions were made, when they happened, and what will come next.*
>
> **Now with Repository Intelligence Mode: Self-aware cognitive architecture with 4 hierarchical levels.**

## 🎯 What Is This?

**Reasoning Layer V3** is a VS Code extension that captures, analyzes, and reasons about your codebase's evolution. Unlike traditional documentation tools, it autonomously:

- 📸 **Captures** development traces (commits, files, dependencies, tests)
- 🧠 **Synthesizes** architectural decisions (ADRs) from evidence
- 🔗 **Correlates** internal decisions with external signals (metrics, feedback, incidents)
- 🔮 **Forecasts** future decisions based on historical patterns
- 🔐 **Maintains** integrity through cryptographic signatures and audit trails
- 🤖 **Self-organizes** its own architecture through cognitive hierarchy

**Think of it as a time-traveling code archaeologist and fortune teller combined into one — with metacognitive awareness.**

---

## 🧠 NEW: Repository Intelligence Mode

The system has achieved **meta-cognitive autonomy** through a self-organized cognitive hierarchy:

## 🧠 Core Concept: RBOM (Reasoning Bill of Materials)

Traditional SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials) list *what* software contains. **RBOM** (Reasoning Bill of Materials) explains *why* it was built that way.

An RBOM captures:
- **Architectural Decisions (ADRs)**: "We chose Redis for caching because..."
- **Evidence**: Links to PRs, issues, discussions, benchmarks
- **Context**: Who made the decision, when, and what triggered it
- **Impact**: How the decision affected the system
- **Evolution**: How decisions were superseded or refined

This transforms hidden tribal knowledge into explicit, searchable, learnable knowledge.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture: 11 Layers of Intelligence

The system is organized into 11 progressively sophisticated layers (7 foundational + 4 cognitive):

### **Layer 1: Code & Structure Capture** ✅
The foundation. Automatically captures:
- Git commits (hash, author, message, diff summary)
- Dependencies (name, version, license via SBOM)
- Configuration files (YAML, TOML, ENV)
- Test reports and coverage
- Build metadata

**Status**: Production-ready | 594 events captured | 0 errors

---

### **Layer 2: Cognitive Layer (RBOM)** ✅
The reasoning core. Generates and manages:
- **RBOM Engine**: ADR CRUD operations with Zod validation
- **Decision Synthesizer**: Auto-detect patterns and generate ADR proposals
- **Evidence Mapper**: Link capture events to ADRs
- **Quality Scorer**: Evaluate evidence strength and completeness

**Metrics**: 8 ADRs generated | 73 high-quality evidence items | Evidence quality distribution tracked

**Example Output**:
```json
{
  "id": "adr-001",
  "title": "Implement Redis caching layer",
  "context": "Performance feedback indicates latency issues",
  "decision": "Add Redis cache for session storage",
  "consequences": "Reduced p99 latency by 60%, increased infra cost by 15%",
  "evidence": [
    { "type": "commit", "quality": 0.85, "ref": "abc123" },
    { "type": "issue", "quality": 0.92, "ref": "#42" }
  ],
  "confidence": 0.87
}
```

---

### **Layer 3: Human & Organizational Context** ✅
Captures the *who* behind the decisions:
- Contributor detection from Git history
- Expertise inference (Testing, Frontend, Backend, Database, DevOps)
- Activity tracking (commit counts, first/last seen, files owned)
- Export to `human-context.json`

**Example**: Detected "Soynido" with 77 commits across 4 domains (Testing, Frontend, Backend, Database)

---

### **Layer 4: Evidence & Trace** ✅
Deep evidence analysis:
- Evidence quality scoring (Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor)
- Evidence grouping by type (PR, Issue, Commit, Benchmark)
- Top evidence display (highest quality first)
- Quality distribution tracking

**Metrics**: 10 evidence items analyzed | 60% average quality | Quality labels assigned

---

### **Layer 5: Integrity & Persistence** ✅
Ensures trustworthiness:
