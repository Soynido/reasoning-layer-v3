## üìÅ Cognitive Hierarchy

The Reasoning Layer is organized in 4 cognitive levels:

### Level 7: Base Engines (Core Reasoning)
Fundamental cognitive engines that learn patterns and generate forecasts.

**Modules:**
- PatternLearningEngine - Learns decision patterns from history
- CorrelationEngine - Detects correlations between events and patterns
- ForecastEngine - Generates future predictions
- ADRGeneratorV2 - Synthesizes ADR proposals
- BiasMonitor - Detects cognitive biases

### Level 8: Cognition (Directed Thinking)
Goal-oriented thinking and task synthesis.

**Modules:**
- GoalSynthesizer - Generates internal goals
- ReflectionManager - Executes goals and decisions
- TaskSynthesizer - Converts goals to tasks

### Level 9: Memory (Auto-Evaluation)
Self-review, historical tracking, and autonomous task generation.

**Modules:**
- SelfReviewEngine - Evaluates cognitive performance
- HistoryManager - Tracks execution cycles
- AutoTaskSynthesizer - Generates tasks from global state
- TaskMemoryManager - Persists task history

### Level 10: Operational Intelligence
Action compilation and system documentation.

**Modules:**
- GoalToActionCompiler - Compiles goals to file-level actions
- FeatureMapper - Maps system capabilities
